# About Meancsript

## Nontechnical

Meanscript is a set of tools for programmers to save and read data in software they are developing. The data can be a text document in a text editor, a save file in a game, or a message between two chatting people to be sent over network, for instance. Meanscript defines a format for data: how it should be represented and organized. That's how Meanscript tools are able to handle the data and provide it to software that is using Meanscript.
Meanscript aims to stand out from the other similar tools by being

* smaller and faster to save computer resources
* available in various programming environments, including those with special limitations by having minimal dependencies to other programming components
* suitable for multiple purposes, like an all-in-one solution for programmers
* easy to expand and modify for the needs of a software that's using it

## Meanscript design fundamentals
* Practical. All-in-one solution for scripting and serializing.
* Minimal core and syntax: small and fast.
* Easy to expand. Integrate to your own source code with your own data types and callbacks.
* Easy to set up, stand-alone. Add Meanscript source code to your project and start scripting! Minimal dependencies to platforms and other software.
* Convenient. Easy to read and write, simple interface, easy to debug, and strong typing and type checking to avoid elusive bugs. Smooth crashing by exception handling, along with informative error messages.
* Iterative, non-blocking bytecode execution.
